SIMDCompressionAndIntersection
======================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lemire/SIMDCompressionAndIntersection.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lemire/SIMDCompressionAndIntersection)

As the name suggests, this is a C/C++ library for fast
compression and intersection of lists of sorted integers using
SIMD instructions. The library focuses on innovative techniques
and very fast schemes, with particular attention to differential
coding. It introduces new SIMD intersections schemes such as
SIMD Galloping.

This library can decode at least 4 billions of compressed integers per second on most
desktop or laptop processors. That is, it can decompress data at a rate of 15 GB/s.
This is significantly faster than generic codecs like gzip, LZO, Snappy or LZ4.

Comparison with the FastPFOR C++ library
-----------------------------------------

The FastPFOR C++ Library available at https://github.com/lemire/FastPFor
implements some of the same compression schemes except that
it is not optimized for the compression of sorted lists of integers.

Other recommended libraries
---------------------------------

* libvbyte: A fast implementation for varbyte 32bit/64bit integer compression https://github.com/cruppstahl/libvbyte
* TurboPFor is a C library that offers lots of interesting optimizations. Well worth checking! (GPL license) https://github.com/powturbo/TurboPFor
* Oroch is a C++ library that offers a usable API (MIT license) https://github.com/ademakov/Oroch

Requirements
------------------------

A CPU (AMD or Intel) with support for SSE2 (Pentium 4 or better) is required
while a CPU with SSE 4.1* (Penryn  [2007] processors or better) is recommended. 


A recent GCC (4.7 or better), Clang, Intel or Visual C++ compiler.

A processor support AVX (Intel or AMD).

Tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows. It should be portable to other platforms.

*- The default makefile might assume AVX support, but AVX is not required. For GCC
compilers you might need the -msse2 flag, but you will not need the -mavx flag.
